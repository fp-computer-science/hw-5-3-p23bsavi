### Audio & Video

Create a copy of all 3 pages from HW 3-2 and rename them to `hw-5-3-page_name.html`. Where page_name is the original name of the page.

Be sure the `hw-5-3-character.html` page contains:

* Audio of you reading the contents of the paragraph on this page. Be sure to include audio controls. The audio should appear between the heading and the paragraph.
* Fix the link so it correctly navigates to the homepage.

Be sure the `hw-5-3-event.html` page contains:

* Video of you explaining the event. You may act it out, explain it verbally, or use another creative medium to summarize the event. The video should appear after the paragraph. Set the height and width so it is appropriately sized.
* Fix the link so it correctly navigates to the homepage.

Be sure the `hw-5-3-home.html` page contains:

* Audio of you reading the contents of the paragraph on this page. Be sure to include audio controls. The audio should appear between the heading and the paragraph.
* Fix the links so they correctly navigate to the character and event pages.
