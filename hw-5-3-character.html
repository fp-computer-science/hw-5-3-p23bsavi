                Luffy starts off as a weak pirate and the clear protagonist of One piece.<br>
                His backstory shows that he is a devil fruit eater. This granted him a certain ability<br>
                From one of the devils of the sea. In return for the power, all eaters of a devil fruit<br>
                Lose the ablity to swim. Luffy ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi fruit, turning his body into rubber.
