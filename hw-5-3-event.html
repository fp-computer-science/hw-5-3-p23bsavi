            <h1>Luffy's victory over Moria</h1>

            <p>
            Moria is the main antagonist in the Thriller Bark arc of One Piece.<br>
            At first his power remains unknown. But as Luffy and his crew begins to <br>
            Defeat more and more of Moria's underlings, it is revealed that he too ate <br>
            A devil fruit power. Moria ate the Kage Kage no Mi fruit which allowed him to <br>
            Take away people's shadows. Luffy defeats Moria by absorbing shadows of nearby <br>
            Survivors of Moria's tricks and becoming Nightmare Luffy.
